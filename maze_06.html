        <h1>Bioinformatics</h1>
        <i>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">Wikipedia</a>, the free encyclopedia</i>
        <p><b>Bioinformatics</b> is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for
            understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology,
            computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data.
            Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical
            techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology,
            as well as a specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics">genomics</a>.
            Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene">genes</a> and single nucleotide
            polymorphisms (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism">SNPs</a>).
            Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic
            basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences
            between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational
            principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics">proteomics</a>.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Bioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In experimental
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology">molecular biology</a>,
            bioinformatics techniques such as image and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing">signal processing</a> allow extraction of useful
            results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their
            observed mutations. It plays a role in the text mining of biological literature and the development of
            biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of
            gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in the comparison of genetic and genomic
            data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more
            integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important
            part of systems biology. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_biology">structural biology</a>,
            it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA,
            proteins as well as biomolecular interactions.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Historically, the term bioinformatics did not mean what it means today. Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper coined
            it in 1970 to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems. This definition placed
            bioinformatics as a field parallel to biochemistry (the study of chemical processes in biological systems).

        <h4>Sequences</h4>
        <p>
            Computers became essential in molecular biology when protein sequences became available after Frederick Sanger
            determined the sequence of insulin in the early 1950s. Comparing multiple sequences manually turned out to be
            impractical. A pioneer in the field was Margaret Oakley Dayhoff.[12] She compiled one of the first protein
            sequence databases, initially published as books[13] and pioneered methods of sequence alignment and molecular
            evolution. Another early contributor to bioinformatics was Elvin A. Kabat,
            who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences
            released with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991.
